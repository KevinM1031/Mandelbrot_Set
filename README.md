# Mandelbrot_Set_Explorer

Otherwise used to create desktop background images, this one of many Mandelbrot Explorers in the world is capable of applying custom color schemes and the rate of color transition. This application is not perfect, and although quite rare, can crash. Window is formatted for Mac OS, as when I made this, I was not very knowledgeable with Java GUI building.

A second version which will grant more flexibility and perhaps antialiasing is planned but unknown if it will ever be done.
